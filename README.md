# Information-theoretic approach to musical complexity

This repository contains the relevant datasets, codes and results of a term-project for the course *Information Theory for Cognitive Scientists* taught at University of Warsaw. The project attempted to gauge musical complexity (understood as Shannonian information content) of classical music pieces from Baroque period to contemporary classical music.
